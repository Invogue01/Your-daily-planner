# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

Simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## About

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
CAN add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT THEY can manage my time effectively
```

## Function

```

WHEN YOU open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN YOU scroll down
THEN you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN you view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN you click into a timeblock
THEN you can enter an event
WHEN you click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN you refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
